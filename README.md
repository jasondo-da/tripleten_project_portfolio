# :computer: TripleTen Project Portfolio

Welcome to my TripleTen project repository! This repository is a collection of Python projects I completed during my tenure at the TripleTen data analytics program. This portfolio will showcase my technical skills and expertise in database management, data analysis, and data manipulation using Python. 


| Project Link | Technical Skills Used | Libraries Used | Project Description | Web Application |

| :memo:[A/B Test Project](https://github.com/jasondo-da/tripleten_project_portfolio/blob/main/Sprint%2010%20%20-%20AB%20Test/README.md) | Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, Correlation Matrices, Hypothesis Testing, A/B Testing, Data Visualization | Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib | This project is focused on two parts: analyzing a list of potential hypotheses and initiating an A/B test to find the best revenue generating hypothesis. The first dataset introduces various hypotheses and their rating in reach, impact, confidence, and effort. The second dataset includes transaction IDs, visitor IDs, revenue accumulated, and other relevant information. Completing this project includes pre-processing data, calculating both ICE and RICE rating methods, A/B testing, and converting the result into visuals. | - |
| :factory:[AtliQ Hardware Customer Analysis](https://github.com/jasondo-da/tripleten_project_portfolio/blob/main/Sprint%2012%20-%20AtliQ/README.md) | SQL Querying, Data Cleaning, Data Wrangling, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Developing Insights, Data Visualization | Pandas, SQLite3, Matplotlib | As a junior analyst for a third-party consulting agency, our client AtliQ Hardware is interested in learning more about their primary customer demographic. AtliQ Hardware has provided us with a backup of their database in the SQLite format and has also restricted the ability to load the full database. The backup database includes data on customers, products, sales records, and other relevant information. | - |
| :red_car:[Secondary Market Automobile Sales Analysis](https://github.com/jasondo-da/tripleten_project_portfolio/blob/main/Sprint%206%20-%20Python%20Car%20App/README.md) | Data Cleaning, Data Visualization, Building and Maintaining Multiple Python Environments, Creating a Web Application, Uploading Web App to a Cloud Service Provider | Pandas, Streamlit, Plotly | This project is to provide a dataset record of car sales. These records include the price of sale, model, model year, condition, odometer, manufacturer, and other important information about vehicle sales. To complete this project, requires data cleaning, data visualization, and knowledge of how to use GitHub and render to build and upload the web application to a cloud streaming service. | :oncoming_automobile:[Web Application](https://car-ad-project.onrender.com/) |
| :shopping_cart:[Instacart Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/jasondo-da/tripleten_project_portfolio/blob/main/Sprint%207%20-%20insta_project/README.md) | Data Cleaning, Data Wrangling, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Visualization | Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib | Using a modified version of Instacart 2017 data, this project is a test to see if we can clean all the errors and process the data of the modified Instacart data. The database includes Instacart orders, products, departments, and other important information. To complete this project will require high attention to detail during the cleaning and pre-processing section and a deep understanding of the data to accurately report customer behavior through easy-to-read visuals. | - |
| :iphone:[Megaline Mobile Carrier Machine Learning Model](https://github.com/jasondo-da/tripleten_project_portfolio/blob/main/Sprint%2011%20-%20Machine%20Learning/README.md) | Processing Data Sets, Defining Functions, Data Visualization, Trained and Tested Multiple Machine Learning Models | Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib |Megaline wants to develop a model that would analyze subscribers' behavior and recommend one of Megaline's newer plans: Smart or Ultra. Megaline gave permission to access the behavioral database about subscribers who have already switched to the new plans. This dataset includes records from calls, messages, and other communication-related records. To complete our goals, we are going to split the sample data into a training set, a validation set, and a test set and input these data sets into various models to find the model with the highest accuracy score. | - |
| :bar_chart:[Yandex.Afisha Marketing Expense Analysis](https://github.com/jasondo-da/tripleten_project_portfolio/blob/main/Sprint%209%20-%20Yandex/README.md) | Data Cleaning, Data Wrangling, Business Analysis, Cohort Analysis, Data Visualization | Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib | As an intern for Yandex.Afisha our first task is to help optimize the marketing expenses. Yandex.Afisha will allow access to server logs for the visits from June 2017 through May 2018, a large file of all the orders, and marketing expense statistics. The project involves data cleaning, data analysis, business analysis, cohort analysis, and data visualization. | - |
